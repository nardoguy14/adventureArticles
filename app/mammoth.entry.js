In retrospect it would've been much wiser to ease the elevation gain from 0 ( back home) to 10.5 k the next day."

On every side there was something distinct and unique, from the sharp rocky edges of the Minarets, the desolute desert on another side, and the lush tree filled mountain directly ahead. As much as we wanted to push forward down the rim each step took its toll. Breathing definately became harder and a thumping in the head was present telling us to get down. We went back to rest from the trip up. Ibuprofen and two hours of rest were my best friends after that trail in the truck but I was ready for more the next day."),
